# Analysis-on-Electric-Vehicles
Analysis on Electric Vehicles by Innomatic's Research Labs

# Conclusions from the Analysis
# Univariate Analysis:
# Electric Range Distribution 🔋:

Most vehicles have electric ranges within a common range, with a few outliers. This points to the standardization of battery capacities across different vehicle types.
# Legislative Districts 🏙️:

The spread of electric vehicles across various legislative districts shows where adoption is high, highlighting potential areas for infrastructure improvements, such as more charging stations.
# Geographic Distribution 🌍:

Electric vehicle adoption is concentrated in certain locations, likely due to government incentives 💰 or the availability of charging infrastructure ⚡.
# Bivariate Analysis:
# Electric Range vs. Model Year 🔋📅:

Over time, both PHEVs and BEVs have shown increasing electric ranges, with BEVs generally having a higher range than PHEVs. This trend reflects technological advancements and improvements in battery efficiency.
# Electric Vehicle Types & CAFV Eligibility 🚗📊:

The BEV category has the highest count of vehicles eligible for the CAFV rebate, indicating that these vehicles often meet the necessary standards for incentives, outperforming PHEVs and BEVx.
# Electric Range by Vehicle Make (Top 20) 🔧📈:

The boxplot shows the spread of electric ranges across the top 20 vehicle makes. Some makes have more consistent ranges, while others show greater variability, suggesting differences in technology or design across manufacturers.
# Electric Range by State (Top 10 States) 🌍🔋:

The boxplot highlights how electric vehicle ranges vary across the top 10 states. Some states have better average electric ranges, possibly due to differences in vehicle models or local incentives supporting high-range vehicles.
# Overall Conclusion:
This analysis reveals key trends in the adoption and performance of electric vehicles across various dimensions, such as geographic distribution, technological evolution, and rebate eligibility.

The increasing electric range over time demonstrates ongoing improvements in battery technology, particularly in BEVs.
Geographic patterns show which states and districts are leading in electric vehicle adoption, indicating where infrastructure investment and incentives could make the biggest impact.
Visualizations like boxplots and the bar chart race provide a dynamic view of electric vehicle performance across states, manufacturers, and models, helping manufacturers and policymakers identify areas for further growth and improvement.
This information can guide decisions on where to expand infrastructure, promote higher-range vehicles, and optimize government incentives for cleaner transportation.
